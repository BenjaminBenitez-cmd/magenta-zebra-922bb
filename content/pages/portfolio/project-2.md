EJB Electric is a residential and commercial maintenance company. They offer electrical, electronic, and HVAC installation, repair, and consulting services.

## The Challenge 


EJB Electric’s problem was fairly simple they need a way to display all their services online. 


## The Solution


A website equipped with all the company’s information and a contact form was the solution to this client’s needs. I went the traditional way of creating websites for this one - static with PHP modules. Since the client decided that customizability was not a huge concern, we decided that a template would suffice. I customized the template with the company’s information and added a contact form. Lastly, I set up the client’s website on a hosting platform and assisted them with their domain purchase.



## The Result

The client was excited about their new website. Customers were now able to see the services they provided without having to call them. This has increased their presence within the island and the country.
