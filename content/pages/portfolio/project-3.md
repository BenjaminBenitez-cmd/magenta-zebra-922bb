After watching videos of "car detailing" I decided it would be a good idea to create an application that would enable the scheduling of car washes with the click of a button.

## The Challenge:

The challenge I aimed to fix is that many individuals need a way to wash their cars without the hassle of driving the car to the establishment. Also, car detailing and wash companies also need the resources to track customer locations and manage appointments.

## The Solution:

I decided that the best approach to the problem would be to create a RESTful API, driver dashboard, and a client application. These would work together to facilitate the process of scheduling car washes. I designed the RESTful API using Node JS, Express, and MongoDB. For the front end, I implemented the dashboard using React JS and Bootstrap. The use of these technologies allowed me to quickly develop this prototype. Unfortunately, I was unable to create the mobile app, as planned, due to technical difficulty(Laptop broke). 


## The Result

The RESTful API and client-facing web application were completed. Having only previously worked on only the front-end side of things meant that I had a lot of learning to do. The result was amazing and I had the opportunity to learn a lot along the way. Find the source code for this project on my Github profile!
