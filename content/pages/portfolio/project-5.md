Another personal project. Whatsapp’s recent Privacy Policy changes have many flocking to alternative messaging platforms. One of these platforms, Telegram, is very "developer-friendly”. It features a well-documented SDK that can be harness to create solutions that facilitate our business processes. 

## The Challenge

Sometimes voice messages can be difficult to listen to. It could be that you are commuting or if you are like me prefer reading. 


## The Solution

To tackle this problem, I decided to develop a speech-to-text bot. I decided to use Telegram’s SDK to program the bot and IBM Watson’s Text-to-speech service to handle the transcoding.

## The Result

The completed bot now allows me to easily convert any voice messages without even leaving the chat application. This completed bot also serves as an example of the numerous things that are possible with Telegram chatbots.
