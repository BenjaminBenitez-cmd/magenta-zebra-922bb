Delivery Pro is another of my personal projects. Delivery Pro(Name still not yet finalized) will be a last-mile delivery assistant.

## The Challenge

Small companies within the sectors of local delivery may not find it financially feasible to develop an entire suite to assist in the delivery of their products.

## The Solution

Delivery Pro will solve the local delivery problem. It will feature a company dashboard, driverâ€™s application as well as a public API that will enable subscribed companies to integrate their Delivery Pro instance into their existing applications.

## The Result

I am still developing the MVP. Stay updated by visiting this section.
