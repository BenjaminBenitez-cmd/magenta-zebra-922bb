Delivery Pro is another of my personal projects. Delivery Pro(Name still not yet finalized) will be a last-mile delivery assistant. 


## The Challenge:

Small companies within the sectors of local delivery may not find it financially feasible to develop an entire suite to assist in the delivery of their products. 


## The Solution:

Delivery Pro will solve the local delivery problem. It will feature a company dashboard, driverâ€™s application as well as a public API that will enable subscribed companies to integrate their Delivery Pro instance into their existing applications. 

## The Result:

I am still developing the MVP. Stay updated by visiting this section.
