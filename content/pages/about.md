I am Benjamin Benitez, a developer living in the country of Belize. Building things have fascinated me since my early days. I enjoy the process of organizing requirements to create solutions.  This is why I enjoy web development, I get to turn business processes into working applications. My education includes an associate’s degree in Computer Science.

I am currently interested in web development frameworks and technologies. My current technology stack is the PERN(PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node Js) stack. Whenever I am not coding I enjoy learning new things, spending time with family, and listening to music.
